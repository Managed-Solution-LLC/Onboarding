- Safe for all corporate environments

#### Quick Scan (Faster)
```powershell
.\NetworkDiscovery.ps1 -SkipTraceroute
```
- Skips detailed routing analysis for faster execution
- Takes 2-3 minutes to complete
- Good for basic connectivity assessment

#### Comprehensive Policy Assessment
```powershell
.\NetworkDiscovery.ps1 -FullSiteScan
```
- Tests additional website categories to identify filtering policies
- Includes gaming, entertainment, and other categories typically blocked
- **Use only if requested** by your IT consultant
- Takes 10-15 minutes to complete

#### Custom Output Location
```powershell
.\NetworkDiscovery.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Temp\MyNetworkReport.txt"
```

### Step 6: Wait for Completion
- The script will display progress information as it runs
- **Standard scan**: 5-10 minutes
- **Quick scan**: 2-3 minutes  
- **Full scan**: 10-15 minutes
- Do not close the PowerShell window while it's running

### Step 7: Locate the Results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Execution Policy" Error
**Error**: `cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system`

**Solution**:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### "Access Denied" Error
**Problem**: Script not running as Administrator

**Solution**: 
1. Close PowerShell
2. Right-click on PowerShell icon
3. Select "Run as Administrator"
4. Try again

#### Script Takes a Long Time
**Normal behavior**: 
- **Standard scan with traceroute**: 5-10 minutes
- **Full site scan**: 10-15 minutes
- Network tests and traceroute analysis take time

**What to do**: 
- Wait for completion (look for progress messages)
- Use `-SkipTraceroute` for faster execution if needed
- Do not close the window

#### No Output File Created
**Check**:
1. Look in the same folder as the script for the timestamped file
2. Check if PowerShell showed any error messages
3. Ensure you have write permissions to the folder
4. Try specifying a custom output path: `-OutputPath "C:\Temp\Report.txt"`

#### Traceroute Analysis Fails
**Common causes**:
- Network firewalls blocking traceroute
- ICMP disabled on network
- Very restrictive network policies

**Solution**: Use `-SkipTraceroute` to bypass this analysis
